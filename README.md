# My-Beat
Where you make the news - posting local stories to share with your neighbors and city. 

In newspaper parlance, a beat is the subject area that a reporter is assigned to cover. Beat reporters can cover everything from local crime to a specific sports team. They develop expertise in their beat areaâ€”getting to know the right people, cultivating contacts, and earning the trust of those who have the information they need. - Rachel Deahl
